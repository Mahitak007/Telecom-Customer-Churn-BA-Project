# Telecom Churn – Process Mapping

This folder contains the process mapping for the Telecom Customer Churn project, showing both the **AS-IS** and **TO-BE** workflows.

## AS-IS Process
The AS-IS diagram illustrates the current workflow of customer churn management. Key issues include:
- Reactive retention efforts after customers disengage
- Lack of customer segmentation for targeted campaigns
- Insights only available after revenue loss
