# Telecom Churn – Process Mapping

This folder contains the process mapping for the Telecom Customer Churn project, showing both the **AS-IS** and **TO-BE** workflows.

## AS-IS Process
The AS-IS diagram illustrates the current workflow of customer churn management. Key issues include:
- Reactive retention efforts after customers disengage
- Lack of customer segmentation for targeted campaigns
- Insights only available after revenue loss


## TO-BE Process
The TO-BE diagram presents the optimized process addressing AS-IS pain points. Improvements include:
- Proactive monitoring of customer engagement
- Targeted retention campaigns with segmentation
- Follow-up tracking to ensure long-term retention
- Real-time revenue insights to anticipate losses
