# Telecom Customer Churn Hypotheses

## 1. Contract Type Hypothesis
Customers on month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn than those on one- or two-year contracts, as longer commitments increase stickiness.

## 2. Service Utilization Hypothesis
Customers who do not subscribe to value-added services (OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport) are more likely to churn due to lower perceived product value.

## 3. Tenure Hypothesis
Newer customers (short tenure) are at higher risk of churn compared to long-term customers, as they haven’t yet developed loyalty.

## 4. Monthly Charges Hypothesis
High MonthlyCharges correlate with higher churn among low-tenure customers, indicating price sensitivity among newer customers.

## 5. Streaming Services Hypothesis
Customers not using StreamingTV or StreamingMovies are more likely to churn, as engagement with entertainment services increases retention.

## 6. Billing Preference Hypothesis
Customers who prefer paperless billing may be more engaged and less likely to churn compared to those using traditional billing methods.

## 7. Demographics Hypothesis
Senior citizens or customers without partners/dependents might exhibit different churn behavior due to unique service needs and engagement patterns.
