Churn Hypnothesis

Contract Type Hypothesis
Customers on month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn than those on one- or two-year contracts, as longer commitments increase stickiness.

Service Utilization Hypothesis
Customers who do not subscribe to value-added services (OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport) are more likely to churn due to lower perceived product value.

Tenure Hypothesis
Customers with shorter tenure are at higher risk of churn compared to long-term customers, as they haven’t yet developed loyalty.

Billing Preference Hypothesis
Customers who prefer paperless billing may be more engaged and less likely to churn compared to those using traditional billing methods.

Monthly Charges Hypothesis
High MonthlyCharges correlate with higher churn among low-tenure customers, indicating price sensitivity among newer customers.

Streaming Services Hypothesis
Customers not using StreamingTV or StreamingMovies are more likely to churn, as engagement with entertainment services increases retention.

Demographics Hypothesis
Senior citizens or customers without partners/dependents might have different churn behavior due to different service needs and engagement patterns.
