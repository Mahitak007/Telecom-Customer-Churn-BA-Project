1. Service Gap Hypothesis
Customers are leaving because the company is not delivering services as promised. Examples include slower internet speeds, missing features, or unfulfilled contract commitments.

2. Competitive Pricing Hypothesis
Customers are more likely to churn if competitors offer better pricing, plans, or additional facilities, particularly among price-sensitive segments.

3. Customer Service Interaction Hypothesis
Limited, delayed, or unsatisfactory customer support increases the likelihood of churn. Customers who feel unsupported may switch to competitors.

4. Contract and Tenure Hypothesis
Customers on month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn than those on 1- or 2-year contracts.
Newer customers (short tenure) are at higher risk of leaving due to low engagement or unmet expectations.

5. Product/Service Usage Hypothesis
Customers subscribing to multiple services (internet, streaming, phone) are less likely to churn.
Customers not using key add-on services (e.g., online security, tech support) may perceive lower value and churn faster.

6. Pricing and Billing Hypothesis
Customers with higher monthly charges, without perceived added value, are more likely to churn.
Billing preferences (paperless vs. traditional) may influence satisfaction and retention.

7. Demographics Hypothesis
Senior citizens may have unique churn patterns, potentially influenced by tech adoption or service needs.
Customers with partners or dependents (family plans) may show different retention behaviors due to multiple service lines.

8. External Factors Hypothesis
Promotions or better packages from competitors can cause spikes in churn.
Regional infrastructure issues or connectivity problems may result in higher churn in specific locations.
